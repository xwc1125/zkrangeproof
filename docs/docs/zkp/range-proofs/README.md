# Welcome to ZK Range Proofs Documentation

INGâ€™s Zero Knowledge Range Proofs (released 2017) was developed as a means to addressing one 
of the largest issues of distributed ledgers, that of privacy of data. Range proofs allows 
for the verification that a data set falls within a defined range while protecting the exact 
figure i.e. a consumer had enough to apply for a mortgage but would not need to reveal the 
exact amount they earned.
