# Welcome to ZK Set Membership Documentation

INGâ€™s Zero Knowledge Set Membership (released 2018) builds on the previous work 
of Range Proofs. Unlike Range Proofs, Set Memberships also allows the user to 
validate that data falls within a particular class or category, without providing
more information than necessary i.e. a person could confirm they lived within the 
EU without giving away their country of residency.
