# Welcome to Bulletproofs Documentation

Bulletproofs is INGâ€™s newest development in Zero Knowledge Proofs (released 2019). 
As well as being more efficient than previous iterations, Bulletproofs addresses a 
major issue seen in most Zero Knowledge solutions, that of trusted set-up. Bulletproofs 
can be defined as non-trusted set-up, meaning unlike other solutions such as zk-SNARKs, 
Bulletproofs does not rely on the integrity of the creator, and could therefore not be 
exploited by said creator. As such this development provides a far higher degree of trust 
for all users on the Blockchain.
